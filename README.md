[![puppet-newrelic](https://img.shields.io/puppetforge/v/fsalum/newrelic.svg)](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/fsalum/newrelic) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/fsalum/puppet-newrelic.png)](http://travis-ci.org/fsalum/puppet-newrelic)

This module manages and installs the New Relic Server Monitoring and PHP agents.  

Supported systems: Debian and RHEL osfamily Linux.

Operating System
----------------

Tested on CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu and Windows.

Windows support added/tested/supported by [malaikah](https://github.com/malaikah).

IMPORTANT
---------

Module version 4.x was refactored. A lot of parameters were added, removed, renamed or changed.

Module version 4.0.1 is moving away from defined classes, deprecation warnings were added.
Using the new classes is backwards compatible.

Review all the parameters you use before deploying this module in production.

Quick Start
-----------

To install the Newrelic Server Monitoring and the PHP agent packages, include the following in your manifest file:

    node default {
      class { '::newrelic::server::linux':
        newrelic_license_key => 'your license key here',
      }

      class { '::newrelic::agent::php':
        newrelic_license_key => 'your license key here',
        newrelic_ini_appname => 'Your PHP Application',
      }
    }

To do the same for a Windows .Net host, include the following:

    node default {
         class {'newrelic::server::windows':
           newrelic_license_key => 'your license key here',
         }

         class {'newrelic::agent::dotnet':
           newrelic_license_key  => 'your license key here',
         }
    }

(Note that, while it is possible to specify a version of the .Net agent, caution should be excercised if doing this. Newrelic make only the last two releases available on http://download.newrelic.com/dot_net_agent/release/.)

If you use Ubuntu 14.04 and php5-fpm you can pass an array of directories for PHP ini files:

      class { '::newrelic::agent::php':
        newrelic_license_key  => 'your license key here',
        newrelic_ini_appname  => 'Your PHP Application',
        newrelic_php_conf_dir => ['/etc/php5/mods-available/conf.d','/etc/php5/fpm/conf.d'],
      }

Parameters
----------

There are a lot of parameters you can customize, check the `.pp` files and the [New Relic documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/php/php-agent-phpini-settings) to understand them.

Mandatory parameters:

* newrelic_license_key
