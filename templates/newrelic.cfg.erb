#
# This is a configuration template for the New Relic daemon - a communications
# proxy between New Relic agents (such as the PHP agent) and the New Relic
# data collectors. This configuration file is required *ONLY* if you need or
# want to start the New Relic daemon at system boot time using init. In order
# to do so you must execute the following commands (as root):
#
# For CentOS and RedHat systems:
#    /sbin/chkconfig newrelic-daemon on
#
# For Ubuntu and Debian systems:
#    /usr/sbin/update-rc.d newrelic-daemon defaults 90 10
#    /usr/sbin/update-rc.d newrelic-daemon enable
#
# For other systems please consult your documentation on how to enable and
# disable services.
#
# For all systems:
#    /etc/init.d/newrelic-daemon start
#
# The startup scripts will only start the daemon if there is a valid daemon
# configuration file in place. This file is, by default:
#
#    /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg
#
# If that file does not exist, you can copy this template file to that
# location and edit it to suit your system needs.
#
# By default the daemon is not started at system boot time, and does not use
# the /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg file. Rather, the daemon is started by the
# agent automatically on startup and is configured by the agent (for example
# when using the PHP agent the daemon parameters are set in the global INI
# file and all begin with 'newrelic.daemon').
#
# There are certain circumstances under which you may want the daemon to be
# started at boot time rather than by the agent. If you use a chroot jail for
# running the agent in, if you have multiple web servers or FastCGI process
# managers, or if you use PHP on the command line a lot for batch processing
# then you may want to start the daemon once at system boot rather than having
# the agent start it.
#
# Below are the various options you can change that affect the daemon. Each
# one is explained in detail along with it's default value.
#

#
# Setting: pidfile
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the name of the file that the daemon writes its process ID
#          (PID) to. This is used by the startup and shutdown script to know
#          which process to monitor or kill.
# Default: OS-dependent. Uses a filename of newrelic-daemon.pid in the first
#          directory from the list /var/run or /var/pid that is found.
#pidfile=/var/run/newrelic-daemon.pid
<%- if @newrelic_daemon_pidfile -%>
pidfile=<%= @newrelic_daemon_pidfile %>
<%- end -%>

#
# Setting: logfile
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the name of the file to record log messages in. If this file
#          does not exist it is created. If it cannot be created the daemon
#          will not start up. The amount of information sent to this file is
#          controlled by the loglevel settings, defined below.
# Default: /var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log
#logfile=/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log
<%- if @newrelic_daemon_logfile -%>
logfile=<%= @newrelic_daemon_logfile %>
<%- end -%>

#
# Setting: loglevel
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the level of detail of log messages sent to the log file. This
#          variable can control the log level for different subsystem at
#          different levels, although such custom usage should only be done at
#          the request of New Relic technical support. The simplest setting is
#          to use one of the following keywords, in increasing order of detail:
#          error - only error messages
#          warning - only warning and error messages
#          info - only minimal startup and shutdown info
#          verbose - slightly more verbose than info, not commonly used
#          debug - very verbose, includes messages only relevant to support
#          verbosedebug - extremely verbose, creates massive log files
# Default: info
#loglevel=info
<%- if @newrelic_daemon_loglevel -%>
loglevel=<%= @newrelic_daemon_loglevel %>
<%- end -%>

#
# Setting: port
# Type   : String or Integer (1-65534)
# Purpose: Sets how the agent and daemon communicate. How this is set can impact
#          performance. The default is to use a UNIX-domain socket located at
#          /tmp/.newrelic.sock. If you want to use UNIX domain sockets then
#          this value must begin with a "/". If you set this to an integer
#          value in the range 1-65534, then this will instruct the daemon to
#          listen on a normal TCP socket on the port specified. This may be
#          easier to use if you are using a chroot environment.
#          In order to use a port in the range 1-1023, the daemon must be
#          started by the super-user. This is a fundamental OS limitation
#          and not one imposed by the daemon itself.
# Default: "/tmp/.newrelic.sock"
#port="/tmp/.newrelic.sock"
<%- if @newrelic_daemon_port -%>
port=<%= @newrelic_daemon_port %>
<%- end -%>

#
# Setting: ssl
# Type   : boolean
# Purpose: If you prefer the daemon to use the secure HTTP (https) protocol
#          when communicating with the New Relic collector servers, set this
#          to true.
# Default: true (as of version 3.6)
#ssl=true
<%- if @newrelic_daemon_ssl -%>
ssl=<%= @newrelic_daemon_ssl %>
<%- end -%>

#
# Setting: ssl_ca_bundle
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM
#          format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used
#          to authenticate the New Relic collector servers. If ssl_ca_path
#          is also set (see below), the certificates in this file will be
#          searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the
#          ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when ssl
#          is set to false.
# Default: none
#ssl_ca_bundle=
<%- if @newrelic_daemon_ssl_ca_bundle -%>
ssl_ca_bundle=<%= @newrelic_daemon_ssl_ca_bundle %>
<%- end -%>

#
# Setting: ssl_ca_path
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates
#          in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be
#          used to authenticate the New Relic collector servers. If
#          ssl_ca_bundle is also set (see above), it will be searched first
#          followed by the certificates contained in ssl_ca_path. This
#          setting has no effect when ssl is set to false.
# Default: none
#ssl_ca_path=
<%- if @newrelic_daemon_ssl_ca_path -%>
ssl_ca_path=<%= @newrelic_daemon_ssl_ca_path %>
<%- end -%>

#
# Setting: proxy
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Some networks are configured to require the use of an egress proxy
#          server in order to communicate with the outside world. Since the
#          daemon needs to communicate with the New Relic data collection
#          servers you may need to instruct it to use a proxy server. Your
#          system or network administrator should be able to provide you with
#          the details.
#          This string is in the form [user[:password]]@hostname[:port] with
#          the user, password and port fields being optional. Some examples:
#          myusername:secret@10.1.1.1:12345
#          someuser@proxy.mydomain.com:4321
#          proxy.mydomain.com
# Default: none
#proxy=
<%- if @newrelic_daemon_proxy -%>
proxy=<%= @newrelic_daemon_proxy %>
<%- end -%>

#
# Setting: collector_host
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the host name of the New Relic data collector host to use.
#          Please note that this is NOT any form of local host. It refers to
#          the New Relic provided host. There is very little reason to ever
#          change this from the default except in certain very special
#          circumstances, and then only on instruction from a New Relic sales
#          person or support staff member.
# Default: collector.newrelic.com
#collector_host=collector.newrelic.com
<%- if @newrelic_daemon_collector_host -%>
collector_host=<%= @newrelic_daemon_collector_host %>
<%- end -%>

#
# Setting: auditlog
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the name of a file to record all uncompressed, un-encoded
#          content that is sent from your machine to the New Relic servers.
#          This includes the full URL for each command along with the payload
#          delivered with the command. This allows you to satisfy yourself
#          that the agent is not sending any sensitive data to our servers.
#          This file must be a different file to the logfile setting above.
#          If you set it to the same name audit logging will be silently
#          ignored.
# Default: None
#auditlog=/var/log/newrelic/audit.log
<%- if @newrelic_daemon_auditlog -%>
auditlog=<%= @newrelic_daemon_auditlog %>
<%- end -%>

#
# Option : hostname
# Value  : Sets the hostname of the server as it appears in New Relic. The
# server agent does not support spaces, and special characters besides
# hyphens -, underscores _, and periods . are discouraged. The name is
# restricted to 64 characters.
# Default: OS-level hostname
#
<%- if @newrelic_hostname -%>
hostname=<%= @newrelic_hostname %>
